## Acknowledgments

I am pleased to have successfully completed the Frontend Mentor - Mortgage Repayment Calculator challenge. This project allowed me to apply my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build an interactive and responsive mortgage calculator. I focused on ensuring that the user interface is intuitive and visually appealing across all devices, from desktops to mobile screens. The challenge gave me the opportunity to enhance my problem-solving abilities, refine my CSS layout techniques for responsiveness, and improve my JavaScript skills by creating dynamic calculations. Overall, it was a rewarding experience that deepened my understanding of frontend development and gave me confidence in building fully functional, user-friendly web applications.
